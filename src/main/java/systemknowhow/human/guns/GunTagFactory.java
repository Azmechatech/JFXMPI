 * Krishna said pointing at a metallurgist who sees only steel, be it ... ship,
 * spoon and nail. He called that metallurgist 'sato guni' or 'tatva gyani'
 * because all of the items and its form, size and utility make it none
 * different. 
 * 
 * Krishna found another person who is not a metallurgist but knew
 * very well each of the different utilities of a ship, and spoon and nail. That
 * He called is, rajo guni or 'brahm gyani'. This person is, of course,
 * intensely creative and worldly wise, and knew the value and uses of each and
 * everything, but not very concerned with the content that causes values in
 * these objects. 
 * 
 * Krishna found yet another person who knows value of only those
 * things which belonged to him, and finds no use or value in things that does
 * not belong to him. This determination, is tamo guna, 'rudra gyani' or
 * conscious of rights/ ownership. That man could even be said as blind man who
 * though knows utility of the objects but is unmindful of ship which can sink
 * in ocean but would not accept a nail which he owns, getting harmed in anyway.
 * And any loss of ownership of a nail to him equals sinking of the ship of all
 * other. 
 * 
 * Finally, the sum of the three, sato guna, rajo guna and tamo guna
 * makes it nirguna or colorless guna. That includes all the three, and yet
 * excludes all three. Nirguna is just as sun light which includes all seven
 * colors and yet none of these colors appear in it.
